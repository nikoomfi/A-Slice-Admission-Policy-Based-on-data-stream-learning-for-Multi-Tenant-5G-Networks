# A-Slice-Admission-Policy-Based-on-data-stream-learning-for-Multi-Tenant-5G-Networks
Network slicing is a promising technology to provide customized virtual and
logical networks for industry verticals. Distinct use cases in 5G networks, such as advanced
mobile broadband, highly reliable low-latency communications, and the massive Internet of
Things, have their own quality of service requirements that must be supported. Network slice
providers must implement an admission control mechanism to make admission decisions
based on supporting quality of service )Qos) requirements as well as physical resource
availability. This article proposes an approach encompassing intelligent and efficient
mechanisms for admission control and resource allocation for network slicing in the 5G core
network. The admission control mechanism based on Data stream learning which consider
the Qos requirements of 5G use-cases, differentiate network core nodes from edge nodes, and
process slice requests in time windows to favor the service providerâ€™s profit and resource
utilization. Results show that Data stream learning overcome existing mechanisms for
managing admission control and resource allocation in 5G core network slicing.
